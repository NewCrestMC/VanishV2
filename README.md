## original info

Unlike the others vanish plugins VanishV2 can hide the items you're holding and your armor you have on you,

VanishV2 can remove you from the online players list to be incognito when you are checking for cheaters.

Finnally, with VanishV2 you can choose with the permission vanish.see who can see you when you're vanished.
